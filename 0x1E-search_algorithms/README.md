search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. Search algorithms work to retrieve information stored within particular data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values. 
This project explains the practical usage of time and space complexity of algorithms. space complexity entails the total space occupied in comparison with input memory. Space complexity includes both auxilliary complexity and time complexity.
